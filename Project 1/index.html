          <h2>south Asian Islamic philosopher, poet and politician</h2>
          <p>
            Allama Iqbal, born Muhammad Iqbal on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, Punjab (now in Pakistan), was a philosopher, poet, and politician in British India who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement. He is considered one of the most important figures in Urdu literature, with his literary work being known for its profound philosophical themes and reflection on social, political, and spiritual issues.

Early Life and Education
Iqbal was born into a Kashmiri Brahmin family that had converted to Islam in the 17th century. His father, Sheikh Noor Muhammad, was a tailor, and his mother, Imam Bibi, was a pious and humble woman. Iqbal received his early education in Sialkot and later moved to Lahore, where he studied philosophy, English literature, and Arabic at Government College. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1897 and his Master of Arts degree in 1899.

Higher Education and Career
Iqbal went to Europe for higher studies, obtaining a degree in philosophy from the University of Cambridge in 1906. He then studied law at Lincoln's Inn, London, and earned a doctorate in philosophy from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1908. His dissertation, "The Development of Metaphysics in Persia," highlighted his deep understanding of Islamic philosophy.

Upon returning to India, Iqbal started practicing law in Lahore. However, his passion for poetry and philosophy continued to flourish. He became a key figure in the literary circles of Lahore and started to gain recognition as a poet.

Literary Contributions
Iqbal's poetry is characterized by its deep philosophical and spiritual insights. He wrote primarily in Persian and Urdu, and his works include:

Asrar-e-Khudi (Secrets of the Self): Published in 1915, this Persian poem emphasizes the importance of selfhood and individuality.
Rumuz-e-Bekhudi (The Secrets of Selflessness): A sequel to Asrar-e-Khudi, focusing on the importance of selflessness and the collective well-being of the community.
Bang-i-Dra (The Call of the Marching Bell): A collection of Urdu poems that includes patriotic songs, philosophical reflections, and spiritual insights.
Zarb-i-Kalim (The Rod of Moses): This work is a call to Muslims to regain their lost glory through self-awareness and action.
Javid Nama (The Book of Eternity): A poetic exposition of Iqbal's vision of spiritual evolution and the ultimate destiny of humanity.
Political Ideology and Role in Pakistan Movement
Iqbal's political thoughts were influenced by his deep understanding of Islamic teachings and his experiences in the West. He envisioned a separate homeland for Muslims in India, where they could practice their religion and culture freely. This vision laid the groundwork for the creation of Pakistan. In his famous 1930 address at the Allahabad session of the All India Muslim League, Iqbal articulated the idea of a separate Muslim state in northwest India, which later became Pakistan.

Legacy and Death
Allama Iqbal passed away on April 21, 1938, in Lahore. His legacy continues to inspire millions in Pakistan and beyond. He is remembered as a national poet in Pakistan, with his poetry and philosophy influencing generations. His vision for an independent Muslim state materialized with the creation of Pakistan in 1947.

Iqbal's contributions to literature, philosophy, and the political awakening of Muslims in India have cemented his place as one of the greatest thinkers and poets of the 20th century. His works remain relevant, providing profound insights into the challenges of modernity, the importance of self-awareness, and the need for a collective vision for progress and unity.
